# React Native Dimensions API Issue on Android

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions, particularly on Android devices.  The `Dimensions` API may return incorrect or undefined values during the initial render, resulting in layout problems and calculation errors. The solution provided addresses this by ensuring that the dimensions are correctly retrieved after the layout has been fully determined.

## Problem

The `Dimensions` API, while generally reliable, can be unreliable when accessed before the layout is completed, often resulting in `undefined` values or incorrect dimensions being used in calculations. This is particularly true for Android devices.  

## Solution

The provided solution uses the `useEffect` hook and the `Dimensions.addEventListener` method to ensure that the dimensions are retrieved accurately after the component mounts and the layout is complete. The `onLayout` event is used to trigger the dimension retrieval once the layout has been finalized.
